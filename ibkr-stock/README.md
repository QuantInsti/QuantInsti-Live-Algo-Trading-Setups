> A Python framework for automated stock trading using the Interactive Brokers API.

## Overview

This framework provides a complete algorithmic trading solution for stock markets using the Interactive Brokers API. It includes risk management, real-time data processing, and machine learning-powered strategy development capabilities.

## Key Features

### Core Trading Engine
- **Interactive Brokers API Integration:** Connects to the Interactive Brokers API for market data and trade execution.
- **Order and Position Management:** Includes functionality for automated order placement and position tracking.
- **Error Handling:** Provides a foundation for error handling and recovery in a live trading environment.

### Customizable Strategy Framework
- **Example Machine Learning Strategy:** Provides a sample strategy using a Random Forest algorithm to demonstrate the setup's capabilities.
- **Flexible and Customizable:** You are meant to modify or replace the logic in `user_config/strategy.py`. The structure allows for integrating various technical indicators and analysis techniques.

### Data & Risk Management
- **Data Utilities:** Includes scripts for downloading historical data and handling real-time data streams.
- **Risk Management Tools:** The setup provides functions to manage risk, such as calculating position sizes and setting stop-loss/take-profit orders. The specific logic for how these are used is defined within your strategy file.
- **Performance Tracking:** The setup includes comprehensive logging and a structure for generating Excel-based reports for analysis.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or higher

- TWS (Trader Workstation) or IB Gateway

### Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
conda create --name stock_trading python=3.12
conda activate stock_trading

pip install dist/ibkr-stock-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl

# Install Interactive Brokers API
# You should download it from IB and install in your environment
```

## Usage

To get started with the trading bot, follow these steps:

1.  **Install the package**: Make sure you have installed the package from the `.whl` file as described in the Installation section.
2.  **Configure Parameters**: Open `user_config/main.py` to set up your trading parameters. This is where you'll define your account details, the stock symbol to trade, data frequency, and other core settings.
3.  **Customize Your Strategy**: The trading logic is located in `user_config/strategy.py`. You can modify the existing strategy or implement your own from scratch in this file.
4.  **Run the Bot**: Once configured, you can start the trading bot by running the following command from the `ibkr-stock` directory:
    ```bash
    python user_config/main.py
    ```

You can further customize the setup by adjusting risk management settings and configuring email notifications within the configuration files.
