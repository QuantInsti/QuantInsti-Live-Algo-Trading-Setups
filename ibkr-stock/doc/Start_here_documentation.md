## Introduction
This document provides a working version of a Python-based setup for algorithmic stock trading using the Interactive Brokers API. This script allows you to execute transactions in the stock market with a customizable strategy and interchangeable stock assets.

The script-based application is intended to demonstrate the use of a ready-made, IB-API-based trading setup and its functionality during each trading period.

<a id='crucial_attributes'></a>
## Crucial Attributes:
- **End-to-End Stock Trading Setup**: A comprehensive solution for algorithmic stock trading, managing data from download and processing to strategy execution and order management.
- **Strategy Customization**: The setup is designed for full customization. You can modify the provided strategy or implement your own by editing the `strategy.py` file, tailoring the trading logic to your specific requirements and risk tolerance.
- **Flexible Asset Selection**: You can trade any stock available through Interactive Brokers. The setup can be easily configured for different assets.
- **Interactive Brokers API Integration**: Seamless integration with the Interactive Brokers API provides reliable access to real-time market data and trade execution.
- **Script-Based Operation**: The setup is entirely script-based, without a graphical user interface, making it lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy and automate. This also facilitates understanding and modification of the code.

## Setup notes
1. If you want to use the same strategy to check how the setup works, you should only need to modify the "main.py" file . In case you want to modify the strategy at your convenience, you should also modify the "strategy.py" file (both files are located in the "user_config" folder). Only stock contracts should be traded with this trading app.
2. If you run the trading setup for the first time, you'll see that you'll be downloading historical minute data. It will take like 3 to 5 days to complete the downloading (it will download from 2005 to 2024). This only happens at the very first time. Once you have the historical minute data up to date, you'll have the trading setup running.
3. The stock market closes at 4 pm Eastern time and the stop-loss and take-profit targets get discarded at market close. Each day the setup will close all the existing positions before market close. 
4. The setup will not leave any open positions on weekends. 
5. The strategy is based on bagging with a random forest algorithm. It creates long and short signals. To learn more about it, you can refer to the MLT-04 lecture.
6. The trading setup is designed to retrieve historical data from up to 10 previous days. If your historical data has missing data for more than 10 days, you'll need to run the setup to download historical data and update the dataframe.
7. In case you want to get the live equity curve of the strategy, once you start trading, you should go to the "database.xlsx" Excel file, sheet "cash_balance", column "value". You can plot that column to see the equity curve graphically.
8. In case you want to make more changes to the setup so it can be better customized per your needs, you can modify all the other relevant files as needed.

## Interactive Brokers setup requirements

1. You should install the **offline stable** version of the TWS. You should save the TWS file in "path_to/Jts/tws_platform"
2. You should install the **stable** version of the IB API. You should save the IB API files in "path_to/Jts/tws_api"
3. You should log in with your account credentials in the IB web platform and then go to Settings. Next, in the "Account Configuration" section, you should click on "Paper Trading Account". Finally, you should click on the "Yes" button against the question "Share real-time market data subscriptions with paper trading account?" and click on "Save". You should wait at least 2 hours to let IB make the paper account have market data subscriptions.
4. In the TWS or IB Gateway platform, you should do the following: Go to File, Global configuration, API, and in Settings:
    1. Check "ActiveX and Socket Clients"
    2. Uncheck the "Read-Only API"
    3. In the "send instrument-specific attributes for dual-mode API client in" box, you should select "operator timezone".
    4. You can click on the "Reset API order ID sequence" whenever you need to restart paper or live trading.
5. In the TWS or IB Gateway platform, you should do the following: Go to File, Global configuration, Configuration and in "Lock and Exit":
    - In the "Set Auto Logoff Timer" section, you should choose your local time to auto-log off or auto-restart the platform. Due to the IB platform specifications, in case you select auto-restart, it must restart at the specific hour you select. You should be careful with this. When selecting auto restart, sometimes it doesn't work properly, so you might need to log in to the platform again manually. 
6. In Configuration, Export trade Reports, you should check the "Export trade reports periodically".
7. In the same section from above, in the "Export filename", you should type: "\path_to\Jts\setup\user_config\data\reports\report.txt". This file will give you a trade report of all the trading positions you took while trading.
8. In the same section from above, in the "Export directory", you should type: "\path_to\Jts\setup\user_config\data\reports". This folder will be used to save the trade report from above.
9. In the same section above, you should specify the interval at which you would like the reports to be generated.
10. Depending on your initial equity and trading frequency, you will have different equity curves throughout time. If you first want to try paper trading, you should set the initial equity value. To do this, you should go to https://www.interactivebrokers.co.uk/sso/Login and do the following:
    1. Select "Paper", instead of "Live"
    2. Login with your username and password
    3. Go to "Settings"
    4. Go to "Account Settings"
    5. In "Configuration", you should click on the nut button of the "Paper Trading Account Reset"
    6. In the "Select Reset Amount" box, you should click on "Other Amount". In the "Amount" box, you should write a specific amount you want to use as an initial equity value. You should read the below instructions and click on Continue.
11. In case you want to reset the paper trading account to default settings, you should do the following:
    1. You should drop all the created files saved in the "data" folder and sub-folders.
    2. You should go to the TWS platform, go to the "File" tab, click on "Global Configuration", click on "API settings", and click on the "Reset API order ID sequence" button. Finally, you should click on "Apply" and "Ok". Then you can paper trade once again from the start. In case you have live traded, you should close any existing position on any asset before you restart live trading with the app.
12. To profit from stock leverage, you need to **ask IB to have a margin account for stocks**. If you don't do it, you will not be able to trade at all your capacity.

## Setup of variables
Inside the "main.py" file, you can change the following variables per your trading requirements. Each variable is explained and some extra information is added.

### Core Trading Configuration
- **account**: The account name of your IB account. This account name starts with U followed by a number for a live trading account and starts with DU followed by a number for a paper trading account. The system automatically detects paper vs live accounts based on the port number (4796/4001 for live, 7497 for paper). You can learn more in the TBP-01 lecture.

- **timezone**: You should set the timezone of your country of residence using the format 'Continent/City' (e.g., 'America/Lima', 'Europe/London', 'Asia/Tokyo'). This is used to convert between your local time and the stock exchange timezone for proper trading schedule calculations. The system uses pytz library for timezone handling.

- **port**: The port number for connecting to IB TWS or Gateway. Common ports: 7497 (paper trading), 7496 (live trading TWS), 4001 (live trading Gateway). The system uses this to determine if you're using paper or live trading.

- **host**: The host address for connecting to IB TWS or Gateway. You should typically set it to '127.0.0.1' for local connections. This is passed to the IB API's connect() method.

- **client_id**: A unique identifier for this trading application instance. It must be different from other applications connected to the same TWS/Gateway. The system uses this to establish the connection and manage multiple client sessions.

- **account_currency**: The base currency of your IB account (e.g., 'USD', 'EUR', 'INR'). This is used for capital calculations and currency conversions when trading stocks denominated in different currencies.

- **symbol**: The stock symbol to be traded (e.g., 'AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL'). It must be a valid symbol available on the specified primary exchange. The system uses this to create the contract object for trading.

- **primary_exchange**: The primary exchange where the stock is listed (e.g., 'NYSE', 'NASDAQ', 'NSE'). This is used to fetch contract details and trading hours from IB. The system calls `get_tradable_dates_and_stock_currency()` to get exchange-specific information.

- **tick_size**: The minimum price movement for the stock (e.g., 0.01 for penny stocks, 0.05 for others). You should set it to 0.0 for automatic detection from IB contract details. It is used for price rounding in order placement.

### Trading Strategy Configuration
- **trading_type**: The trading strategy schedule with three options:
  - 'intraday': You can trade throughout the day at specified intervals
  - 'open_to_close': You can trade from market open to close with position management
  - 'close_to_open': You can trade from market close to next day's open (overnight positions)
  The system uses this to determine trading windows and position management logic.

- **data_frequency**: The frequency for data bars and trading decisions (e.g., '5min', '15min', '1h', '1D'). The system converts this to IB API bar size format and calculates periods per day. For daily trading, you should use '1D'. Higher frequencies require more computational time for signal generation.

- **restart_time**: The local timezone time for TWS auto-restart in 'HH:MM' format (e.g., '23:00'). The system uses this to schedule daily restarts and ensure fresh connections. It must match your TWS auto-restart setting.

- **time_after_open**: Minutes to wait after market open before starting trades (default: 2). This avoids initial market volatility and ensures stable price feeds.

- **time_before_close**: Minutes before market close to stop trading (default: 150). This ensures all positions are properly managed before market close.

### Machine Learning and Optimization
- **optimization**: Boolean flag to enable/disable strategy parameter optimization. When True, the system runs `strategy_parameter_optimization()` to train new models. When False, it uses existing pre-trained models.

- **daily_optimization**: Boolean flag to enable/disable daily model retraining. When True, the system checks if optimization is needed for the current trading day and runs optimization if required.

- **base_df_address**: File path for the feature-engineered dataframe (e.g., 'app_base_df.csv'). This contains technical indicators and features used by the machine learning model. The system loads this for signal generation.

- **train_span**: Number of historical periods to use for model training (default: 3500). This determines how much historical data is used to fit the machine learning model. It should be less than available data in your historical dataset.

- **test_span_days**: Number of days to use for validation/testing (default: 1). The system multiplies this by periods per day to get the test span. It is used for model evaluation and backtesting.

- **seed**: Random seed for reproducible model training (default: 2025). The system uses this to generate multiple random seeds for ensemble model creation. Each seed creates a different model variant.

### Risk Management
- **risk_management_bool**: Boolean flag to enable/disable risk management features. When True, the system automatically places stop-loss and take-profit orders. When False, only market orders are placed.

- **trail**: Boolean flag to enable/disable trailing stop-loss orders. When True, it uses IB's TRAIL order type. When False, it uses standard STP stop-loss orders. The trailing stop follows the price movement.

- **leverage**: Position sizing multiplier (default: 0.02 = 2% of capital). This determines what percentage of your account capital to risk per trade. The system calculates position size as: (capital * leverage) / current_price.

### Execution Settings
- **smart_bool**: Boolean flag to enable/disable IB SMART routing. When True, it uses 'SMART' exchange for order routing. When False, it uses the stock's primary exchange. SMART routing finds the best execution venue.

- **fractional_shares**: Boolean flag to enable/disable fractional share trading. When True, it allows decimal quantities in orders. When False, it rounds to whole shares. It requires account support for fractional trading.

### Strategy File
- **strategy_file**: Name of the strategy file to import (default: 'strategy.py'). The system dynamically imports this file to access strategy functions like `get_signal()`, `set_stop_loss_price()`, etc.

### Email Notifications
- **smtp_username**: Your Gmail address for sending trading notifications (e.g., 'youremail@gmail.com'). The system uses this to authenticate with Gmail's SMTP server.

- **to_email**: The email address to receive trading notifications (e.g., 'youremail@gmail.com'). It can be the same as smtp_username or different. The system sends daily trading summaries to this address.

- **password**: Your Gmail app password (16-character string). This is NOT your regular Gmail password. You must generate an app password in your Google Account settings. The system uses this for SMTP authentication.

### Additional Strategy Variables
You can add additional variables in the "Set the additional variables you would like to add for the strategy functions" section of main.py. These variables are passed to your strategy functions and can be used to customize trading parameters. For example:
- `num_technical_indicators`: Number of technical indicators to calculate
- `leverage`: Override the default leverage setting
- Any other parameters your strategy functions need

### System-Generated Variables
The following variables are automatically calculated by the system and you should not modify them:
- `test_span`: Calculated as `test_span_days * periods_per_day`
- `historical_data_address`: Set to 'data/historical_data.csv'
- `model_datetime`: Set to the current trading day for model loading
- `stock_timezone`: Retrieved from IB contract details
- `fractional_shares`: Set based on account capabilities
