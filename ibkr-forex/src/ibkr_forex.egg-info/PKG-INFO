## Usage

To get started with the trading bot, follow these steps:

1.  **Install the package**: Make sure you have installed the package from the `.whl` file as described in the Installation section.
2.  **Configure Parameters**: Open `user_config/main.py` to set up your trading parameters. This is where you'll define your account details, the forex pair to trade, data frequency, and other core settings.
3.  **Customize Your Strategy**: The trading logic is located in `user_config/strategy.py`. You can modify the existing strategy or implement your own from scratch in this file.
4.  **Run the Bot**: Once configured, you can start the trading bot by running the following command from the `ibkr-forex` directory:
    ```bash
